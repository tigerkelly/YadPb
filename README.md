Once a project has been created the use can start be adding different dialogs to the project.

Each dialog has its own set of command line options, plus the general options that go with each dialog.

The program can create the command line for of each of the dialogs created.  The command can be added to a Bash script

Please refer to the manual pages of the YAD program.

Linux tiger 5.15.0-52-generic #58-Ubuntu SMP Thu Oct 13 08:03:55 UTC 2022 x86\_64 x86\_64 x86\_64 GNU/Linux

I created this with Java 18 and JavaFX 19 on a Ubuntu system
openjdk version "18.0.2-ea" 2022-07-19
OpenJDK Runtime Environment (build 18.0.2-ea+9-Ubuntu-222.04)
OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM (build 18.0.2-ea+9-Ubuntu-222.04, mixed mode, sharing)

OpenFX SDK 19

I used apt install to get Java 18 and downloaded openfx 19 from the web. I installed javafx into my local
directory but you can install it whereever.

The environment varaible PATH\_TO\_FX needs to point to the lib directory of the javafx install.

The file yadpbfx.zip is an export of my Eclipse project.
The directory YabPb if the home directory of the YadPb program.  Copy this directory to you home directory.
    cp -r YadPb ~/

Also copy the yadpb script in the bin directory to you bin directory.

The directory yadpbfx is the source code to the YadPb program.
